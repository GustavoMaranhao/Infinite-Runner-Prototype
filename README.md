# Infinite-Runner-Prototype
Project developed as a sample of my work to be submitted with a job application.

The game has simple graphics, all created using either Unity's built-in tools for 3D meshes. The purpose of the game is to demonstrate some gameplay mechanics related to procedural map assets generation for use in a infinite runner type game.
